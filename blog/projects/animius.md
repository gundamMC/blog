Animius is an open source software library for creating deep-learning-powered virtual assistants. It provides an intuitive workflow that extracts data from existing media (such as anime and TV shows) and trains on them to provide a personalized AI. The flexible architecture enables you to add custom functionality to your virtual assistant.

It is based on python and Tensorflow (with heavy reliance on the 1.x layer architecture).

## Extensions

There are also other projects surrounding the base engine, such as clients and middleware.

- [animius-anywhere](https://github.com/gundamMC/animius-anywhere) - WIP mobile client built with Vue Native and Socket.IO
- [animius-link](https://github.com/gundamMC/animius-link) - Python middleware providing additional functions like weather and other API calls
- animius-ui - Electron & Vue desktop client integrating animius with Live2D support (repo currently not available)
