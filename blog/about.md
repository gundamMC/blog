## Quick Bio

Hey! I'm Shuming, a current undergrad student at UC Berkeley aiming for a double major in Computer Science and Cognitive Science.
I started programing in elementary school due to Minecraft and eventually learned about machine learning in high school. Ever since then,
I've been fascinated by AI and Deep Learning, and I am constantly seeking to create new possibilities with technology.

## Programming Language/Frameworks

For ML/DL projects, I mostly use Python with [Tensorflow](https://www.tensorflow.org/). Outside of ML, I also have experience with desktop
applications using C# with WPF and building websites with [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/). For frontends, I tend to favor [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/).
I've also played around with [Unity](https://unity.com/) to integrate intelligent AI into 3D simulated worlds.
