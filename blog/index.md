::: slot about
Hey! I'm Shuming, a current undergrad student at UC Berkeley, California.
I dedicate my time in researching areas of CS and AI - especially machine and deep learning -
to brighten communities and animate technology. My most recent work is [Animius](https://github.com/gundamMC/animius),
a deep-learning engine for personalized virtual assistants.
